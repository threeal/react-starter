# React Starter

A minimalist template for starting a new [React](https://react.dev/) project.

This template provides a basic React project containing a sample web application written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), with built-in support for formatting, linting, testing, and continuous integration.

## Key Features

- Minimal React project written in TypeScript with [ESM](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) support.
- Uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager.
- Supports formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
- Fixes formatting and linting during pre-commit hooks using [Lefthook](https://lefthook.dev/).
- Preconfigured workflows for [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
- Supports deployment of the web application to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
