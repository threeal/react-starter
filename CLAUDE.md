## About This Repository

A minimal React app starter template, bundled with Vite and deployed to Cloudflare Pages. Its only application code is placeholder pages in `src/pages/`, routed by `src/router.tsx` — real pages are added by projects derived from it.

## Gotchas

- `lefthook run pre-commit` skips every job when nothing is staged, even ones that ignore the staged file list — pass `--all-files` to run it outside an actual commit.
- The pre-commit hook fixes files in place, and the run fails if any file changes. Report that failure and leave the fixes for the user to review and re-stage before committing again.
- Vitest's 100% coverage threshold applies to the whole run, not per file — a single test file can fail on source that other tests cover, so run the full suite (`pnpm vitest run`).
- `.gitignore` ignores every dotfile and dotdir (`.*`) — a new one needs an explicit `!` exception there or it silently won't be tracked.
